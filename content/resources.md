* **Jan 2018**: A talk again specifically for MicroTypes was hosted in APIDays Paris,
that was targeted to more advanced audience and covered the whole MicroTypes definition
along with some parts of the new paradigms that such architecture could lead
(i.e. introspecting capabilities of HTTP APIs for configurability).

* **Oct 2017**: A talk specifically for MicroTypes was hosted in Nordic APIs of the same
year, called [MicroTypes: Composability for HTTP APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc8ZyFjJY4A). The talk covered the problem
definition, along with most parts of MicroType definition, exccept the
configurability properties.

* **Sept 2017**: The first reference for MicroTypes was made through [introspected.rest](https://introspected.rest),
published by Filippos Vasilakis. It was an effort to challenge conventional
REST principles and bridge the gap between REST and RPC.
